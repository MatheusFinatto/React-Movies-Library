<h1>Matheus Finatto's Movies Library</h1>
  <h2><b>This was my first experience with React + API integration :)</b></h2>  
<p>Welcome to Matheus Finatto's Movies Library, a React app that utilizes the TMDB API to display information about movies. Whether you're a movie buff or simply looking for something new to watch, our app has you covered!</p>

<h2>How to Run the App</h2>
<p>To run the app, simply follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the app's repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.</li>
  <li>Run the command <code>npm install</code> to install the necessary dependencies.</li>
  <li>Run the command <code>npm run dev</code> to start the development server.</li>
  <li>Once the server has started, the terminal will display the link where the app is being hosted. For example, the link might be <code>localhost:5127/movies-library</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these simple steps, you'll be able to run the app locally on your machine.</p>
Alternatively, you can view the final result at https://matheusfinatto.github.io/movies-library/. However, please note that due to issues with React Router and GitHub Pages, the movies search feature will not work correctly on the GitHub Pages version of the app. To ensure full functionality, I recommend running the app on localhost, on the main branch.
<p>Thank you for viewing Matheus Finatto's Movies Library! I hope you enjoy using my app as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
